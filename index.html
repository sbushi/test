											<h4><a href ="http://www.att.com/gen/investor-relations?pid=5711">AT&T</a></h4>
											<p>As a <strong>Network Planner</strong> turned <strong>Systems Engineer</strong> at AT&T, I was afforded an opportunity to take on various tasks and develop an assortment of skills. During my 5 year tenure, I committed myself to supporting our 5G, Mobility, FirstNet, and Backbone infrastructure. I traversed the respective silos of application owners, development, and the end userbase to create meaningful value for that userbase. In support of the Network Operations teams that operate the network on a daily basis, I developed, automated, demonstrated, and documented capabilities within various functional areas. Fault Management, Performance Management, Capacity Management, Technology Insertion, Change Management and Logging were all made more efficient through deliverables I helped solution, document, or discuss. Furthermore, my time with AT&T has afforded me educational avenues into Cybersecurity, Big Data, SDN, Cloud Infrastructure, Machine Learning, 5G, Containerization, and most importantly, camaraderie with an exceptional group of coworkers.</p>

											<h4><a href ="http://www.wizcomcorp.com/">Wizcom Corporation</a></h4>
											<p>During my time at Wizcom as a <strong>Technical Intern</strong>, I was able to make a large difference in a small company. Over the course of several months, I went from being an observer to an accomplisher. After shadowing my coworkers, I was able to take on several tasks. I performed UAT testing with the financial trade applications in order to ensure that they worked seamlessly in production. I made sure to keep the development team updated on managerial processes. When any pressing issue would come up, I was sure to notify the team members that were equipped with the knowledge to alleviate the problem. In addition, I was afforded the opportunity to learn and practice UNIX, linux navigation, database management, financial trade analysis, and reporting regulatory discrepencies. At Wizcom, I enjoyed being able to develop my business and technical skills while working with a close-knit family.</p>

											<h4><a href ="http://www.lib.umd.edu/mckeldin">McKeldin University Library</a></h4>
											<p>Working as a <strong>Support Staff Member</strong> at Mckeldin Library, I was tasked with aiding a large body of faculty, students, and patrons. With practice and a gradually forming love for the library, I became an integral member of that body. Among my daily tasks, I resolved computer and network related issues for patrons, I ran the equipment loan database along with my coworkers, and I helped improve the research of various students and faculty by directing them to the proper resources. While doing all these things, I learned the most valuable skill that I constantly work to develop and that is talking to people. I honed my sense of empathy and gained an ability to get a read on an individual's problem and address it in the way they wanted it done. At McKeldin, I enjoyed perfoming the tasks to help out people but I enjoyed interacting with the people, the most.</p>

								<h3>My Involvement:</h3>
								<p>Included below are a few of the clubs and programs that I have been involved in.</p>

								<br />
								<p>As <strong>Vice President of Communications</strong> of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/oxygen-erg/">OXYGEN NJ Employee Resource Group</a> I had the opportunity to impact the AT&T community and an even wider auxiliary community. As the marketing lead, I designed most of the analog and digital media to advertise fundraising events. Additionally, I documented and highlighted these events through photography and videography. Moreover, I enjoyed the ideation of novel, unique events such as Golf Fundraisers, Car Meets, Business Studio Headshots, Ping Pong Tournaments, Video Game Tournaments, March Madness Brackets, and even Virtual Discord Events in response to the Coronavirus pandemic. Beyond the logistics to run those events, the individuals I interfaced with on a weekly basis fueled my drive to better my community. By communicating to a distribution list of 700+ recepients on a monthly basis, I helped foster a sense of care, community, and belonging while fundraising for our national STEM scholarships as an added benefit.</p>

								</div>
								<br />
								<p>As <strong>Vice President</strong> of the <a href="http://www.umdbits.net/">Business Information and Technology Society (BITS)</a> within the Robert H. Smith School of Business, I had the opportunity to extend recruiting opportunities with some of the largest tech firms in the industry, to university students. I worked with our executive board to contact recruiters, set up networking events, pan out the details of those events, and encourage students to attend. Behind the scenes, I updated the club members on upcoming events and maintained the repository of members to its accurate count. I really enjoyed working with a cohort of students that were as passionate about the current business technology industry as I was. Moreover, I shared that passion with students through our events. I really gained an understanding of what it took to run a small organization and how to appeal to the members of that organization.</p>

								</div>
								<br />
								<p>As a <strong>Cited Member</strong> of the <a href="https://www.scholars.umd.edu/programs/bse">Business, Society, and Economy</a> college park scholars program, I had many avenues through which I was able to get involved on and off campus. Within the 2 year runtime of the program, I had an opportunity to serve and teach. During my involvement within the scholars program, I volunteered on service day to help the local community. I got to serve by preparing meals for a local soup kitchen as well as packaging backpacks at a warehouse for incoming school children. Moreover, I got to share my experiences with newly accepted students within the scholars program. Attending class sessions of theirs and delivering my experiences and pitfalls helped them to gain a sense of the scholars program and how to shape it to their liking. I really gained a sense of humility from the service that I performed in scholars and moreover, I learned to effectively communicate those experiences to the next batch of students.</p>
